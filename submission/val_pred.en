when i was 11 years old , i was given by the sound of the sound of the sound .
my father heard on his little , gray radio at the top of the bbc .
he looked very happy at the time , which was quite unusual at the time , because it was mostly unusual .
he called , " the taliban are gone .
i didn 't know what that meant , but it made my father obviously , very happy .
" now you can go to a right school . "
i 'll never forget this morning .
it 's a real school .
the taliban , the power in afghanistan , when i was six , and she was banned girls to go to school .
so i went to sleep for five years as a boy and my older sister who no longer allowed me to go to a secret school .
we were just able to go to school .
every day , we took another way to guess where we went .
we hid our books in the air so it looked like we just go shopping .
we were taught in a house , over 100 girls in a small living room .
in winter , it was comfortable , but in summer , it was incredibly hot .
we all knew that we were going to be our lives : teachers , students and our parents .
and again , all of a sudden , the class had to go to a week because the taliban had calculated .
we never have to be sure about how much they knew about us .
are they watching us .
did you know where we live ?
we were scared , but we wanted to go to school .
i was fortunate enough to grow in a family where education was important and daughters .
my grandfather was far ahead of his time .
a outsiders from a remote province in afghanistan , he insisted , his daughter -- my mother -- to school and was thrown off for him .
my educated mother was a teacher .
that 's her .
two years ago , she went to the booth , just to turn our house into a school for girls and women .
and my father -- here -- here -- the first one in his family , who was ever received a education .
and he was always aware of him , that his children would get a education , even though his daughters , despite the taliban , despite all the risks .
he saw it as a much bigger risk of not sending his kids to school .
i know that in the years , i know that in the years , in the same years , we sometimes were so frustrated by our lives , by the time we live .
i 'd love to give up a good , but my dad said , " daughter , listen to me . you can lose everything in your life .
your money can be stolen . you can be cut in war .
but one thing will always stay you : what 's in here , and even if we have to pay our blood needs for your needs , we will do that .
so , do you want to give up . "
today i am 22 years old .
i grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades .
less than 6 percent of my age of women have higher degree than the school care , and if my family didn 't have to have my education too heavily , i would be one of those women .
instead , i stand here today , as a proud of the college .
when i returned to afghanistan , my grandfather , who was being lifted by his family , because he was able to send his daughters to school , one of the first ones that i was looking at .
he was not just talking about my own office , but also by the fact that i was the first woman and i was walking him through kabul .
my family believe in me .
i have big dreams , but my family has even bigger dreams .
so i 'm global international accounts for the world , a global campaign for women .
and so i 've helped to create the brain industry , the first and maybe only a single country for girls in afghanistan , a country where the girl 's girl is still risky for girls .
it 's wonderful to see how the school at my school with great ambition all of you want to see .
and to see her parents and fathers , like they were , like , my parents , and also , for me , i think , despite all the time .
just like ahmed . this is not his real name , and i can 't show his face , but ahmed is the father of one of my own subjects .
before just a month , his daughter and he was on the way of the police in her village , and they were at the end of the death of a bomb , just to get a little bit of minutes .
when he got home , the phone would stand and he was told he was going to go to school if he sent his daughter to school , they would try it again .
he said , " hey , " kill me now , if you want , but i won 't take the future of my daughter because of your favorite and practice ideas . "
what afghanistan is , i 've realized something that is often going to be more popular in the west : behind most of us who have success , is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and the conscious is that your success is also successful .
that 's not supposed to say that our mothers are not important in our success .
in fact , they 're often the ones that are initially and physically for a very promising future of their daughters , but in a society like the support of the men 's support .
among the taliban , just a few hundred girls , they were illegal .
but today , in afghanistan , over three million girls , the people are now in the workforce .
afghanistan appears , from america , so different .
americans are seeing how secure these changes are .
i 'm afraid that the changes are not about long , and then the cause of the changes again .
but if i see in afghanistan , when i see the school in my school , and your parents who are using themselves for you , i see a very promising future and a change .
afghanistan is a country for me , and the mexican possibilities , and that 's why every day the girls who visit the school .
just like i have big dreams .
thank you .
all i do , also -- my life -- was my life -- was my life , was my young man .
from 1971 to 1977 -- i look young , but i 've been -- i 've been involved in zambia , kenya , the ivory , the ivory , the world 's engineering collaboration , and we 've worked with african collaboration .
i worked for an italian journalist , and every single project we put on the legs .
i was desperate .
i , 21 years , thought that we were a italians good people and good work in africa .
instead , we killed everything .
our first project , which was my first book , " the " the " the ] thing we used to show people to the people , how food is going to grow .
we came up with the seed , in this epic valley , which is leading to the treatment , and we also used to confirm the local population of the growing asian tomatoes and the food and ...
of course , the local agencies had absolutely no interest in it , so we paid them to work , and sometimes they were also starting to happen .
we were amazed that there was no agriculture in such a remarkable valley .
but instead of asking why they don 't mean anything , we just said , " thank god we are here ! "
" just days to save people 's death from death . "
of course , everything is really great .
we had these signature tomatoes . in italy , they were so big in zambia .
we couldn 't believe it , and we said the " the ] way is just agriculture . "
when the tomatoes were visiting and red , overnight , overnight , overnight , overnight .
we said to the " the " oh god , the jill .
and they said , " yeah , that 's why we don 't have agriculture .
" why didn 't you tell us ? " you 've never asked us . "
i just thought we were so high in africa , but then i saw what the americans were doing , what the french did , and after i saw what they did , i became pretty proud of our project in zambia .
we 're at least the case of the food chain .
you should see the nonsense -- you should see the parachute that we 've got to get the african people .
you should read the book " dead from " dead " by the name of the written , it 's a fabulous ball .
the book was published in 2009 .
we 've been given 1,5 trillion dollars to the african continent in the last 50 years .
i 'm not going to tell you what this money has .
just read your book .
read a little bit of a gold we 've got .
we 're western people , we 're more competitive , we 're more vulnerable , and there are only two ways we 're dealing with people . we 're going to be a little bit of a mess .
both words came from the latin root , which means " father . "
but they have two different meanings .
bp : i 'm going to make any of the other culture as if they were my kids . " i love you so much . "
bp : i 'm going to make any of the other culture as if they were my servant .
so white people are becoming the idea of the white people .
i became a lot of time when i read the book " small " by reading " little " and he said , especially in the business of the market , when people don 't want to help , let 's go .
this should be the first principle of aid .
the first principle of aid is respect .
this morning , the gentleman who ran this conference , a pole on the floor and said , " can you imagine a city that 's not worth caring ? "
when i was 27 years old , i decided to just react to people and invented a system called the market , where never gets to be blamed , never someone gets to be blamed , but you become the service of the local passion , the owner of the local people who have the
what you do -- you keep your mouth .
you never get a community with ideas , you join yourself with the local community .
we 're not working by offices .
we 're meeting in cafes . we 're meeting in bars .
we don 't have infrastructure .
we close relationships and find out what the person wants .
the most important thing is passion .
you can convey somebody 's idea .
if this person doesn 't like this , what do you want to do ?
the passion for your growth is the most important thing .
the passion for your growing is the most important thing .
we help them find knowledge , because nobody can be successful .
the person with the idea may not know that , but it 's available .
many years ago , i had this question : why , instead of getting into a community and tell people what they 're supposed to do , why don 't we hear them ? but not in the middle of the pyramid .
let me tell you a secret .
there 's a problem with a gun .
entrepreneurs never have part of , and they will never say publicly what they want to do with their money , what they 're seeing .
planning has this blind spot .
the smartest people of the community don 't know because they never seem to meet public spaces .
we 're working on one to do this , a social infrastructure has to be made .
a new job needs to be created .
this is the director of the company , the main nobel prize of the mirror , who sits with you in the house , and in her coffee , you can help them find the means , their passion in a way to make life .
i 've tried this in the arts , in the way .
i was going to go back to the time and tried to get the most important thing to do , where we say what to do .
i helped these 5 fishermen working together and not sell this amazing tuna to sell 60 cents a pound , but to japan for 15 dollars per pound , and then the farmers came to me and said , " hey , you 've helped them . can you help us ? "
i had been running 27 projects in a year , and the government came to ask me , " how do you do that ?
how do you do -- ? " i said , " i 'm doing something very , very difficult .
i keep the mouth and listen to you . "
so -- so the government says , " do you do it again . "
we 've done it in 300 communities .
we 've helped 40 companies in the process .
there 's a new generation of companies that are coming down from loneliness .
peter , one of the best story of the story , died at 96 years ago .
peter was a scientist , peter , before he deals with companies , peter printer said , is actually incompatible with a society and economics . "
planning is the main part of the process .
so you build the software system , without knowing what the smartest person want to do with their money and their energy .
you have to learn how to get them to a test .
you have to offer them to your privacy and privacy , you have to be great in it to help them , and they will come to get a lot of blood .
in a community of 10 people , we get 000 customers .
can you imagine a community of 400 people who intelligence and passion ?
what presentation do you have the most favorite morning .
local , passionate people . they 've got to do this .
i want to say that entrepreneurship is the correct way .
we 're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil fuels , manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable .
the production rate is not sustainable .
the main cost of the higgs boson is not sustainable .
we have to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways , and we have to cure and can transport them with them .
the technologies are not available .
who 's going to invent this technology for the green revolution ? universities ?
the government ? forget about it .
it will be entrepreneurs . and they 're already doing it .
i read a wonderful story in a magazine a lot ago .
there was a group of experts who invited to discuss the future of new york in 1860 .
in 1860 , they came together and what was going on in 100 years of going on with the city of new york , the conclusion was to rise : the city of new york would not exist in 100 years .
why ? they looked at the curve and said , if the population is growing up in that pace , they needed six million horses to lift the people , and it would be impossible to get the crap from six million horses .
because they were already going to be in the crap .
in 1860 , you see the dirty technology that the life of new york .
what happens ? 40 years later , 1900 , in the united states , was 1001 -- 1001 .
the idea of finding another technology had done the race . there were tiny little factories in the block .
sloth , michigan . henry ford .
there 's a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
first of all , you have to be offered .
otherwise they don 't come and talk to you .
next to the next , you have to get them absolute and passionate .
and then you have to tell you the absolute truth about the entrepreneurship .
from the smallest to the biggest company , all the way to the biggest company , they have to do three things : that must be a universal product that needs to be more tolerant , and the needs to be enormous .
so guess what ?
we never met one person who 's going to produce something , and then you can take care of the money .
it doesn 't exist .
this person was never born .
we 've done research and we 've been looking at the 100 companies in the world -- carnegie , the bankers , the edison , the new companies , google , yahoo .
there 's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have been mean , just one : not one .
now we teach the research project in neuroscience entrepreneurship , and we start teaching the class to give you the first two pages of richard technologies , the job of the original movement is to teach the job of richard 's favorite two sides of richard 's favorite way of doing how often he
never " i " and 32 times " we .
he wasn 't alone when he started .
nobody started a company alone . no one .
so we can create a community , in the facilitator that have a partial background , in cafes and bars , their dedicated ones that will do what someone has done for you for this gentleman who speaks about this talk , somebody who speaks about this talk , and somebody who speaks to them ,
what can you do ? can you make it happen .
okay , can you sell it ? can you pay for the money ? "
" oh , no , i can 't do that . " do you want me to find somebody for you ? "
we 're actively going to activate .
we have groups of volunteers who support the study of helping them find the resources and people , and we 've found that the wonder of intelligence of the local population causes that culture and the economy of these community can change the economy and the economy of these community .
thank you .
five years ago , i learned how to be alice in the middle of the day .
the penn state of university asked me -- a graphic for communication -- highly inspired teaching courses .
i was scared .
right fear . fear of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , no other words .
but when the conversations came , it became like alice , when she went down to the bedrock of the day and seeing a door to a whole new world .
and i felt that when i was talking to students , i was amazed with the students that they had and wanted to know that other people had found that .
i think to open these door , it takes great communication .
we need to have great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world .
because our scientists and engineers are the ones that our biggest problems , such as energy , environment and health , and if we don 't know about it and it doesn 't understand it , it 's not going to be on , and i think it 's in our responsibility as a
but these great conversations are not going to happen when our scientists and engineers don 't invite us to do a child .
so scientists and engineers , please , give us a look .
i want to show you a few ways of showing you that , that we can see that science and technology that you 're busy with , sexy and exciting .
the first question you need to answer is , well , what ?
tell us why is your scientific field so relevant to us .
not only does it tell us that your brain is studying , but also tells us that your brain is changing , the structure in our bones , because it 's important to understand and treat it .
and if you tell that what you do , you will end up .
now , multi-touch of the matter is a barrier to understanding your mind .
i 'm sure you could use " space and time " use , but why don 't you tell " space and time , " which is much more profound for us ?
to make your mind understandable , it 's not the same as your level of life .
as einstein said , " do things like that , " do things as simple as possible .
you can definitely tell us about your scientific territory , without having to have tradeoffs to start .
a few things are to consider , examples , stories and analogies , in this way , you can draw ourselves in your tracks .
and if you were to show your work , the most enjoyable way .
have you ever asked you why it 's called " menu ? "
what happens when somebody 's going to get out of ? another one is going to be a different one , and with these dots , you will have your audience .
a slide like this is not just boring , but it 's also too much to the most part of our brain , and by doing that , we 're very excited .
this is a lot of it from the name brown , and it shows that the special structure of the brain is so stable that it was actually the inspiration for the uniquely design of the brain .
the trick here is , you know , a single , off-the-shelf sentence , where the audience , if it loses the thread , can be used , using images and graphs that also drives our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what you describes .
these are just a few ways that we can help us open these doors and see the light system that the science and technology .
since the engineers i 've been teaching to make the " wizard inside me , i want to summarize everything with the equation .
from your science of your science and your email 's brain , you divide it by the relevance , so the audience , what matters , and multiply the whole thing that you have for your incredible work : and that 's really a particular interactions that are full of new insights .
so scientists and engineers , if you solved this equation , they really gave me .
thank you .
hi . that 's my phone .
a cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom .
with a mobile phone , you can film a crime of humanity in syria .
with a mobile phone , you can tweet a message and start a computer review in egypt .
and with a mobile phone , you can take a song , upload at the heart of the body and be famous .
all of this is possible .
i 'm 1984 and a live in berlin .
let 's go back to this city .
you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to change for change and go .
we 're in the fall of 1989 and we imagine that all these people who asked the people and change , a cell phone in the bag .
who in the room have a cell phone ?
hold it up .
hold your cell phone up , keep it up .
hold it up . an android , a blackberry , wow .
these are many . almost everybody has a cell phone .
but today , i want to talk about myself and my cell phone .
and i 'm going to talk about this .
this is 35.830 lines of information .
data .
and why are this information there .
because in summer , 2006 , the u.s. has a policy .
this is the economic policy .
this policy says that every phone every telephone in europe , every country in the entire europe , has to store a range of needs .
who 's calling who ? who send me an email ?
who send a text message .
and if you use a cell phone , you 're using .
all of this information will burn up for at least six months or two of your phone .
and all over europe , people are standing up and said , " we don 't want to . "
they said , we don 't want to do this .
we want to bring back in the digital age , and we don 't want to know that the phone calls and all of this information about us .
there were lawyers , journalists , priests , everybody who said , " we don 't want to . "
and here you can see how tens of thousands of people were put on the streets of berlin and said , " freedom rather than fear . "
and some people even said this could be 2.0 .
the main puppet was the most respected in the refugee .
and i also wonder if that really works .
can that really store all of this information about us ?
every time i use my phone ?
so i asked my phone , the german police , who was the largest telephone at the time , and i asked her , please send me all the information that you 've stored over me .
and i asked her once , and she asked them , and i didn 't get right answer .
but then i said , i want to have this information because it 's my life that you 're going to get it .
so i decided to take a specialist against them , because i wanted to have this information .
but the german said , no , we 're not going to give you this information .
and then it came to a comparison with them .
i salute the charges , which they all send to me .
because in the meantime , the higgs field decided that the introduction of the united nations was right to german .
so i got this ugly brown cover with a cd .
and on the cd , this was .
35.830 lines of information .
first , i saw it , and i said to myself , well , it 's a big file .
but then i realized after a while , that 's my life .
that 's six months of my life in this file .
so i was a little bit skeptical , what should i do with this ?
because you see where i 'm where i 'm sleeping , what i do .
but then i said , i want to go to the public .
i want to make it more .
because i want to show people what 's called a meaning .
so along with time online , and open data city , i did this .
this is a visualization of six months of my life .
you can 't be able to get your breath and you can go back and forth .
you can 't do any step .
and you can actually see how i 'm going to go from the train to the train for the boat , and how many call i call .
all of this is possible .
that 's a little scared .
but it 's not just about me .
it 's all about all of us .
first , it 's just like , i call my wife , and they call me , and we 're talking about each other .
and then i call some friends , and they call each other .
and after a while , they call them , and they call them , and we have this giant test .
but you can see how people are communicating with each other , they 're going to call them each other .
you can see everything .
you see the central characters , about who are the leaders of the group .
if you have access to that information , you can see what society does .
if you have access to that information , you can control society .
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran .
this is the perfect design , how to monitor a society because you know who is going to talk to who you are sending an email , all this is possible if you have access to that information .
and this information is stored for at least 6 months , in europe to 2 years .
as i said , at the beginning , we imagine that all these people in the streets have had 1989 cell phones in their pocket .
and the insurance community would have known who was in the demonstration , and if the authorities had known , maybe who had the leaders , that might never happen .
the case of the berlin wall may have not happened .
and then , again , not the case of the iron .
because today , government agencies and companies are trying to store as much information as they can get over us , online and forward .
they want to have the opportunity to track our lives , and they want to store it all around them .
but the other thing that 's been in the digital age is not a contradiction .
but you have to fight for the world .
you have to fight that every day .
so when you go home , you tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and that 's not a big deal .
when you go home , you say to your ingenuity , just because companies and government are the ability to store certain information , you don 't have to do it for a long time .
and if you don 't believe me , ask your phone books after the information they stored over you .
so , in the future , every time you use your cell phone , remember you have to fight around the world in the digital age .
thank you .
i live in south central .
this is south central : the animal , the bus , the bus .
so the city meeting , and they started to change the name of south central , so that it 's something that says it 's something else , it changed him in south los angeles , as if it changes something wrong in the city .
this is south los angeles .
it 's a lot of the time .
like 26,5 million other americans , i live in the south of south america , the home of central los angeles and the age of war .
the funny thing is that the people are killing more people than the ones are the ones .
people die in south central los angeles to poor disease .
the serif in my neighborhood is for five times higher than about the beverly hills , which is about 15 kilometers away .
i couldn 't get it .
and i wondered , as you would feel , if you didn 't have access to food , if you go out of the house , the negative effects that the existing food system has to get on the city of the existing food to the neighborhood .
i thought that the phone bought and sold like styrofoam .
i see some of the things that starbucks .
and i realized that .
i 'm going to argue that the problem is the solution .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
and also , i had no more fun to get a apple that 's not a apple that is not made with pesticides .
so i planted a glass of my house .
it 's a piece of land that we call a lot of time .
it 's 45 to 3 feet .
the thing is , it 's the city of the city .
but you have to do it .
so i think , " cool . i can do what i want , because it 's my responsibility , and i have to stay in . "
and i decided to keep it in .
so i came and my group , the l.a. green , and we started to get my food source and feed , to plant plants , so the whole program , vegetables .
we 're kind of a continuum , put out from gardening from all the social layers and from all the city , it 's completely voluntary , and everything we do is free .
and the garden is beautiful .
but then somebody complained .
the city came up to me , and i was basically pushing a science and i said that i needed to remove my garden , which was a very flexible effect .
and i thought , " come on , real ?
a more sensitive charity because of food on a piece of land that you don 't care ? "
and i thought , " cool . come with it .
because this time it wouldn 't work .
the l.a. times got wind from this . steve sillett made a story about it , and spoke to the sunshine department and with a member of green ground , they were a petition on top of the street , and at 900 we were successful .
we held the victory in the hands .
my department actually called , and he said they 're supporting it and love what we do .
so , really , why shouldn 't you do that ?
l.a. has most countries in the city of the city .
they have 67 of the oil lanes .
this is 20 central parks .
this is enough area to plant 725 million cubic million plants .
why the hell should you find this right ?
by growing a plant , you get 1.000 seeds .
with green beans , you get fruit and vegetables at the value of 75 dollars .
it 's my favorite quote , i tell people to grow their own food .
his own food is like your own money .
see , i have a legacy in south america .
i grew up there . i raised my sons .
and i am forced to be part of this being a functional reality that was made by other people , and i 'm my own reality .
see , i 'm an artist .
my graffiti is my graffiti . i plant my art .
just like a finger , the walls of the walls , i 'm going to wipe up lawn and i 'm a little bit .
i use the garden , the earth , like a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees are my main sensory points for this stuff .
you would be surprised to know what the ground can do if you use it as canvas .
you can 't imagine how amazing a color is , and how you touch people .
so what happened ?
i 've seen my garden to an instrument for education and the transformation of my personal note .
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the floor .
we 're the floor .
you would wonder how kids are affected by this .
so , gardening is the most peaceful and responsible act that you can make , especially in the city .
and you get an electrical .
i remember this time when this mother and her daughter came , it was about 10 : 30 at night . they were in my backyard , and i came out and looked like this .
i felt really bad because they were there , and i told them , " you know , you don 't have to do that .
the garden is not without the reason . "
i was struck when i saw people who were so close to me and hungry , and that only made me do this . people said , " oh , don 't worry about that . people like me . "
and i said , " the hell , no , i don 't fear that you 're stealing .
and it 's on the street .
that 's the idea .
i want you to take it , but at the same time , i want you to go back to your health . "
another time i would put a garden in this downtown shop in downtown l.a .
these are the guys who helped me to get the trucks .
it was cool , and she shared her stories about how it affects her , and how they had their mother and her grandmother , and it was great to see how it changed , if it 's just for a moment .
green water has about 20 gardens .
and we got 50 people , and we got <NUM> people and they were all volunteers .
when kids grow food , food is going to eat .
when they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes .
but if you don 't get any of them , if you don 't have to show how food mind and your body influenced , you 're eating blind , whatever you 're going to do .
i see young people who want to work , but they 're in this thing -- i see families who are exactly on the path that are the right to fit for them , and that 's what they 're going to lead to .
the gardening i see as an opportunity where we can train these children to take care of their communities to lead a sustainable life .
and if we do that , who knows ?
we could make the next george washington .
but if we don 't change the composition of the climate change , we will never do that .
so this is one of my plans .
i want to plant a whole bunch of the water on gardens where people can share the food in the same block .
i want to take a final cap and turn it into healthy water .
so , don 't get me wrong .
i 'm not talking about the word " cats , " because free is not sustainable .
the funny thing about sustainability is you have to stay .
i 'm talking about giving people work , and get kids from the streets , and they 're the joy of being pride and the honor of when you get your own food , and if you open up the street .
so what i want to do here is make this sexy .
i want to be sure , we 're all going to become all the green neighborhoods , the world .
we have to turn the image of the laser .
if you 're not a flat , you 're not a diamond player .
you 're going to be in the end of the car , right ?
and let 's take that gun .
if you want to meet with me , don 't call me when you want to walk in a cold chairs and make a meeting where you 're talking about making some of the things .
if you want to meet me , come with your finger , in my backyard , so we can make any of the stuff .
peace . thank you .
thank you .
one of my favorite dictionary in oxford english is " the " ] "
because it sounds so beautiful .
and " sunfish " means " a brilliant politician . "
although in the 19th century , a great definition of a better definition , " a man is somebody who 's a office , regardless of party , " program , " and his success , and by the pure power of the rise of the unconscious of the original "
i have no idea what " mind-boggling " is .
something in words , i think .
but it 's very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know that they have to try to control language .
before 1771 , for example , according to the british parliament , the british parliament , not the exact debate of the debate .
and actually , this went back to the courage of a man called the extraordinary name of the horse .
they threw him in the tower of london and he drew him , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough , he was a bold guy , and he won so much support in london that he won .
and just a few years later , we find the first sign of the sentence " as strong as " happy . "
and so , in contrast , the word is to get the word for the word "
but that 's not true . it goes back to a death of the pirate .
but to show you how words and politics are informed , i want to take you to the united states at the time , at the time .
you saw the question of how to do george washington , the point .
you know , you know .
what is the leader of a nation 's worth of nation ?
it was an infinite amount of debate .
and there were all kinds of urgent suggestions .
i mean , some people wanted to call it " free washington , " and others , his george washington , and again , the freedom of the people 's freedom of people in the united states .
not so much .
some people just wanted to call him king .
they thought that was a crime .
they weren 't suicidal , they wanted to choose the king for a certain time .
it could have worked .
but everybody was bored .
i read the reading of a writing reading who wrote constantly , " still the same topic . "
the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the main was against the senate .
the didn 't want to be a little bit of the target project . they didn 't want it .
king call , and he may be able to get into ideas .
they wanted to give him the most compelling , the greek , the name of the name that you 're looking at .
this title was " president . "
president . they didn 't invent the title . he existed before , but he was just meant to be a meeting .
it 's like the shooting of a jury .
he didn 't have a size of size than the term " chicken " or " the " ] . "
sometimes there were president little guys and the cold , but it was really a nerdy cover .
so the senate was called him .
they said , " that 's ridiculous , you can 't call it president .
this guy has to make a agreements of honor and foreign freedom .
who will be serious if he has a stupid little title like the president of the united states ? "
and there was no 3 weeks of debate .
you can learn about three interesting things .
first of all , i find that i 'm best -- until now , i can 't figure out whether the senate has ever been called president .
barack obama , president obama , he 's just him he just throws the senate .
second , you can learn that when a government says that something is more wrong -- you 're going to wait <NUM> 223 later .
third , and that 's really important , that 's the most important point , is that the " president of the united states of america " today is not so embarrassed , right ?
that has to do with the slightly more than 5000 translators that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet drones and all that stuff .
and the truth and history have given the title .
and so the senate has won .
they have a given title .
and the other concern of the horror , which is like the killer -- well , it was like this .
but you know how many nations have a president ?
147 .
because you want to sound like the guy with the 5000 nuclear license and so on .
so , at the end of the senate , and the principal lost , because nobody felt uncomfortable when you told one that is the president of the united states of america .
and that 's the most important thing you can take , and i 'm going to get away with it .
politicians try to use words to shape reality and control reality , but actually the reality changes much more than words that are going to change the reality .
thank you .
so i came up with about 50 rebels to fight the boat -- a hot , icy surfers from northern , florida .
i was taking my black little card , and i was a few brown bicycle , and i was a rocket towards the most estate i couldn 't even see .
that was the first time i was in afghanistan .
for a long time before , i was big , but besides the war and the police and the federal rights and the equipment with the equipment and the new equipment that " the " near " and the ] 60s , " before i knew what that meant to communism and long and long to see , before
but that 's the geography of self .
and so i 'm standing here , here , acute , wonderful , ceo of god 's own , a physicist and a radically brave artist who lived the last nine years in afghanistan , worked and created .
so , there are many great things in afghanistan that you could do art , but i don 't like to paint a career of paint , and i want to make art that will take the personality and the authority of the reality and actually try and make that reality and that 's even a kind of
i want to spend a day in the life of a jihad that uses his jihad against the word " impactful " and local religious political citizens and political corruption to enrich themselves .
and what else can the drug do is to make the opportunity to go for the parliament and make a message to the phrase , " choose me ! i 'm rich . "
and try to use this campaign to grow these kinds of information that are spending as a function of the brain .
i want to go to the bottom of the corruption in afghanistan , with a project called " the " where you 're a policeman , a fake , a fake street on the streets of kabul and cars , but instead of taking back from them , they provide money and they 're
i want to see the conflict in afghanistan in my opinion , " dark conflict . "
the war and the stranger who were coming with him have created a new environment for building and fashion that you can only capture by using a government and suicide for soldiers in which i 'm putting up in the middle of the suicide of the suicide box , or several times into a delicious metal company .
and i would like to see how a simple serif consists of kabul between 1899 of the <NUM> looks to protect a dialogue about it that the point today is their roots in the kennedy review of " the burden of white men " to protect the brown man to protect themselves , and maybe even a little bit
but for all of these things you can get to jail , you can get rid of them .
but i do , because i have to , because the geography of the self is to the self .
that 's my burden . what is yours ?
thank you .
hi . my name is cameron russell , and i 've been working as a model .
for 10 years , exactly .
i feel that there 's a more appealing tension here in the room , because i should have no one to wear this dress .
fortunately , i 've got something to change .
this is the first time somebody on the ted stage , so you can estimate happy to see this .
if a few women really were really worried about when i came out , they don 't need to say that i 'm going to go to twitter .
i also realize that i 'm pretty privileged , because i can change in very short 10 seconds , what you think of me .
there 's no chance of doing .
these are very uncomfortable , it 's good for me to wear her at anyway .
the hardest part is to move the sweater over my head , because then they 're going to get me all together , don 't do anything until it 's about my head .
all right .
why did i do this ?
that was embarrassing .
well , it was hopefully not as embarrassing as this picture .
a image is powerful , but a picture is also the surface .
i just changed your mind in 6 seconds .
and in this image -- i never had a friend .
i felt very uncomfortable , and the photographer told me i was going to take my back and put my hand into the hair of this guy .
and apart from surgeries or the wrong thing that i 've been doing two days ago for work , there are very few ways to change our thinking , and our energy system has -- although it 's the surface and it 's a lot of impact on our lives .
being more optimistic is to be honest .
and i 'm standing on this stage because i 'm a model .
i 'm standing on this stage because i 'm a lovely , white woman , and in my business , we call this a sexy girl .
i 'm going to answer the questions that people are always asking me , but in the honest way .
the first question is , " how do you get a model ? "
i 'm always saying , " oh , i 've discovered , " but that doesn 't mean anything .
the real reason i became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and a critical legacy , and maybe you ask yourself what this legacy is .
well , in the last few centuries , we have to define beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical , that we are in awe of biological programmed , but also as big , slim , and the droughts .
this legacy was created for me . and it 's a legacy that is worth me .
i know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point , and maybe some of the things that are skeptical like , " stop . "
and first of all , i was going to get her . very impressive .
but unfortunately , i have to tell you that in 2007 , a very early class of the nyu institute of nyu has all the models on the bottom-up level , every single one that was fought , and that 677 , 27 , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> percent of them were not white .
the next question that 's always asked me is , " can i get a model if i 'm grown up ? "
and i say first , i don 't know , that 's not in my responsibility .
but the second answer i really want to give this little girl is , " why ?
you know what ? you can get anything .
you can become the united states , or the next of the next internet or a kind of a girl , which is totally wrong , because then you 'll be the first one . "
if you 're still saying that if you 're still saying that , " no , no , no , cameron , i want to get a model , " and i say , " will my boss . "
because i have no responsibility for nothing , and you could be the national american foundation or the principal of h & amp 's or the next steven .
to say that you want to be a model later , you 're like saying you want to win the dopamine cream in the lottery .
you can 't design it , and it 's fantastic , and it 's not a product .
now i want to demonstrate to you 10 years of continuous exploration because unlike a technology designer , it can only turn it right now .
it looks like this .
hopefully less strange than that .
that was -- i don 't know what 's going on .
if you stop school and have a joint and you 've done a joint and you 've done a few jobs , you can 't say a lot more .
the next question that i often asked me is , " are all the pictures ? "
and yes , pretty much all the pictures are going to be , but that 's just a small part of the brain .
this is the first photograph i did , and that was the first time i was wearing a wooden pad , and i didn 't even have my period .
i know that 's going to be quite personal , but i was a young girl .
so i just saw that a few months earlier .
this is me on the day .
my friend had to go .
this is me on a street track , a few days ago , a few days ago .
this is me with the ministry of the puzzle and the book .
and that 's what i 'm today .
and i hope you can see that these pictures are not pictures of me .
they 're competitive , and they 're a group of professionals , from the federal and writers and photographers and the photographers and all of their assistants and the first and the time and they construct it .
okay , next , i always ask me , " do you get things for free ? "
yes , i 've got too many of the things i can never wear , except , but the things that i get for free are things that i get in real life and that 's not what we 're talking about .
i grew up in cambridge , and one day i went to a store and i forgot my money , and i gave my dress for free .
as a teenager , i was with my friend with a terrible , terrible , and they were a red light , and of course we stopped , and it needed one , " sorry , mr. heifetz , " and we could have been able to go out .
i have these free things about my life , and not because of my personality , and there are people who pay for their money and not pay attention to their personality .
i live in new york and from 140 teenagers who were being stopped in the last year and were being kept , 000 percent of black and latino young men .
it 's in new york only 177 young , male black and latino black , asking not the question : " am i stopping ? "
it 's like , " how often am i going to stop ?
my research for this talk , i found that <NUM> 53 of the girls in the united states don 't like their body , and that number goes up to <NUM> 78 when they turned <NUM> 17
the last question to me is , " how is it to be a model ? "
and i think you expect that the answer , " if you 're a little thinner and you have hair , you feel very happy and amazing . "
and we 're giving up a answer that maybe that impression .
we say , " it 's really great to travel so much , and it 's great to work with creative , inspired , passionate . "
all of that is true , but it 's only half the story , because what we never say before the camera , which i never said before the camera is , " i feel unsure . "
and i feel unsure because i have to think about my way to work every day .
and if you ever ask yourself , " would i be happier if i had a pair of feet and hair ? "
and then you should make a few models , because they have the lowest legs and the hair and the shock and they are probably the most respected women on the planet .
when i was preparing this talk , it seemed very hard to pull a perfect direction , because at least i felt very uncomfortable about putting myself here and say , " i got all the benefits from a pile of that , which doesn 't feel very well , the " and it doesn 't feel very well
it was very difficult to be considered a legacy of oppression because of gender and disability when i was one of the greatest mass of it .
if you take a little bit of this talk , hopefully we 'll all take the power of the image in our perceived and failures .
thank you .
i never forget the words of my grandmother who has come to life in exile , " dear , dear , dear .
but will never be a little bit like a chess sandwich . "
it 's now almost two years since the caribbean revolution has been , inspired by the waves of the death penalty both in the bats and in the egyptian revolution .
i suffered with many other groups , and i 'm in the outside of the room , and outside the time , to start a day of the viewer , and start to start a revolution against the ultimate regime of the millennium center .
and there she was , a big revolution .
young , young women and men were in the first row , asked the other of the regime , would remember the other of freedom , dignity and social justice .
they 've proved intellectual courage by asking themselves against the brutal dictatorship .
they 've shown a strong sense of solidarity from far east across the far east , until the south african .
finally , after a period of six months of suffering , of almost 50.000 deaths , we managed to get our country and drop the beat .
but nonetheless , a large load has left a large load , a legacy of tyranny , the corruption and the foundation for the economy .
over four decades , there has been proven to be both infrastructure , both the infrastructure , and the culture and the moral structure of the society .
the master and the challenges , i kept , like so many other women to rebuild civil society , and we asked a narrative and fair transition to democracy and affordable .
almost 200 organizations were going to be , and immediately after the case , they started to be formed in the center of the day , almost 300 in the south .
after 33 years in exile , i came back to aberdeen , and i started to organize workshops to the issues of the world , to organize human development and development .
with a wonderful group of women , i started the women 's women , a movement of women , leaders from different backgrounds whose goal is to be , public and the right to the level of the elderly 's empowerment and the law of the right to the degree of the equal and the cost of
in the world , i encountered the very difficult environment , a environment that was increasingly stronger , a context that was increasingly stronger , a environments that was defined by the european politics of dominance and the acoustic .
i was led to have a initiative of the women 's women to get a deeper social care system , a law that every citizen , no matter what the background , should be the right to vote and to raise a change and to make a change between male parties and female candidates and a community of opportunity
and we ended up being taken in the end .
women won 17,5 percent of the gdp in the first election for 52 years .
but slowly , though , the great thing that stopped the great axis and the whole revolution -- because every day we were left with new news .
one morning , we went to the national justice station on the national park .
another morning we got news about the murder of the american semester and the attack on the message .
another morning , the principal was signed by the army .
and really every day , we actually experienced under the rule of the race and their gender levels of human abuse and their absence of rules and laws .
our society , upon a very religious sense , of course , and pushed and away from the ideals and principles -- freedom , dignity , social justice -- which started to stop .
intolerance , the builders and currents became the icons of the [ the revolution .
i 'm not there today to inspire you with the success of our election and the elections .
i 'm actually here today to confess that we , as a nation , who made false choice and wrong decisions .
we have our priorities wrong .
because the elections were not going to be peace or safety in the workforce .
did the affect and the change between female and male candidates ?
no , she didn 't .
what is it then .
why is our society continue to become more and dominated by the latest politics of dominance and the ministry of women and women ?
maybe the women were not the only thing that 's missing , but the female values of compassion , the grace and the self-expression of the war .
our society needs a national dialogue and more advanced , when she needed the elections that they have , and they have just moved on the polarization .
our society needs the most powerful embodiment of female than it takes the rise , the quantitative embodiment of the female .
we have to stop acting in the name of the game , and ask a day of revenge .
we need to start acting in the name of compassion and the grace .
we have to develop a female discourse that doesn 't just value the following values , but also organize the following , pray rather than a competition , collaboration instead of cheating .
these are the ideals that require one of the war of the war desperately to reach peace .
because peace has a brain and it 's in this business industry , and it 's about the accumulation of the world 's s and the way that 's the most surprising .
this is the real thing .
and we have to do that for the sake of the time before we do it .
after a verse from the quran " -- peace -- " is the word of god 's god , " is the word of god .
the word " mass " again , which is known in all the known traditions , has the same arabic root as the word " gender " -- as the word " the " -- and the point is the most powerful level that all of humanity is living with all the humanity , which is the male and
and just like the passenger is the embryo that grows inside it , completely , the basic things that reward the most existence .
so we said , " my grace includes all of the things .
so we said , " my grace has some number of minds in front of my life . "
will all of us have been given to all the death penalty .
thank you .
when i was a little bit small , i thought my country was the best of the world , and i grew up with the song " nothing . "
and i was very proud .
in school , we were talking about the story of kim , but we learned not very much about the world , except that america , south korea and japan and japan are enemies of our enemies .
although i was often wondering how the world is , i thought i 'd spend my whole life in north korea , until all the time .
i saw a public failure at first , but i thought my life in north korea was normal .
my family was not poor , and i had to never suffer starvation .
but in 1995 , my mother brought a letter , from the sister of a colleague .
and it said , " if you read this , our five family members will not be in the world because we 've had no more food for two weeks .
we 're standing together on the ground , and our bodies are so weak .
i was so shocked .
i heard for the first time that people were suffering in my country .
shortly after that , i went through the station , and i saw something horrible that i can 't delete anymore from my memory .
a woman was on the floor , and a 10-year-old child in her arm looked into her helpless .
but nobody helped them , because all of these were busy to take care of themselves and their families .
in the 1990s , there was a great famine in north korea .
at the end of the end , more than a million north famine , and many other people survived only because they ate grass , beetles and ate food .
so , the other thing that 's getting more and more and more , so that night around me , all the time , except to me , is to pull out everything on me , except the lights from china .
i always wondered why they had lights there , and we don 't .
this is a segment of north korea and his neighbor at night .
this is the river , which is partly to be part of the border between north korea and china .
as you can see , the river will be very sculptural , and it enables the escape .
but many die .
sometimes i saw the bodies .
i can 't tell a lot about how i left north korea , but i can say that during the yemen years of famine , famine was sent to china .
i just thought i 'd be disconnected for a short time from my family .
i 'd never thought it takes 14 years to get back .
in china , it was very hard to live as young girls .
i had no idea how life would be a child 's worth of high school , but i soon learned that it 's not just extremely difficult , but it 's also very dangerous because , in china , in china , in china , are seen in china as illegal immigrants .
so i was living in constant fear that my real identity could be able to hold , and you would be in a terrible destiny to come to north korea .
one day my worst nightmare was true when i was caught by the chinese police and the police station .
someone was being taught to be a career , so they tested my email and asked me to ask countless questions .
i was like that , i thought , i 'd like to explode my heart .
would anything more wrong , i could be locked up and be locked .
i thought that was the end of my life , but i managed to control my feelings and i ask questions .
after they finished the welfare department , a local official said to the other , " this was a family lamp .
it 's not a rocket . "
and they let me go . it was a miracle .
some north of the north atlantic china in china are caught in the wild , but many people are caught by the chinese police .
these girls were very lucky .
although they realized , eventually , they were released by the vast international pressure .
these were not so fortunate .
every year , ton north koreans are caught in china , where they were tortured , broken or publicly executed .
although i had lucky , i 'm not like that .
it 's tragic that north and the north is to fight their identity and fight hard to survive .
and even after having been learned a new language and work , your world can be put on your head in a moment .
after 10 years of the year , i decided to go to south korea , and i started to have a new life .
i was going to have to close in south korea , a bigger challenge .
english was so important in south korea that i had to start learning my third language .
and i also have seen the big difference between north and south korea .
we 're all koreans , but we have very , very focused in the inside of the 67 years .
i went to a school .
am i a lawyer or a bust ?
where am i going to do ?
suddenly there was no country to have my home .
although i didn 't light up the hadn life , i had a plan .
i was doing the job at the university of the university .
just as i was traveling to my new life , i got a call .
the federal authorities started the money i sent to my family , and as punishment , my family was going to go home , to a remote place on the country .
they had to escape as fast as possible , so i started planning their escape .
north atlantic to freedom have to be freedom .
it 's almost impossible to cross the border between north and south korea , where i took a flight back to china , and i went to the north limit to the city of the city .
because my family didn 't speak chinese , i had to run them , on more than 2.000 miles in china , and then to southeast asia .
the shuttle took a week , and we were getting almost caught .
once the bus was stopped , a chinese was in the middle .
he took the whole number of people and started asking questions .
because my family didn 't mind chinese , i thought they would be arrested .
when the chinese officer , i stood up , i stood up and told him that they were being more aggressive , and i was her favorite .
he looked suspicious , but he thought he believed me .
we managed to go to the rough border , but i had to use almost all my money to bribe the main plastic from the north of the body .
but even after we 'd finished the border , my family was being washed because of illegal air .
after i paid high school and bribe , my family was released within a month , but for soon my family , my family 's capital was in the capital of the city of christchurch .
this was one of the biggest breakthroughs in my life .
i had done everything to help my family to freedom , and we were so close to , but my family was arrested , just before the third message .
i went back and forth between the school department and the police industry , trying to raise my family , but i didn 't have enough money to pay back or pay a bribe .
i lost all my hope .
and i was asked to say a man 's voice , " what 's going on ?
i was completely surprised that a stranger was about to take care of it .
in english , and with a dictionary , i explained my situation and no hesitation , he went to a rescue party , and paid the money for my family and two other north america to get them out of jail .
i thanked him from my hearts and said , " why do you help me ? "
" i don 't help them , " he said .
" i cure the people .
i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
the congolese stranger for me to be a new hope that had to have the north koreans so far , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the north koreans that the north koreans needed .
finally , after our long trip , my family and i united nations , i was united states , but i was just a step .
many north koreans are separated by their families , and once they get in a new country , they start with little or no money .
the international community can help us in education , the one of the things that we 're doing is , you know , the world , the world , the world 's rights ,
we can also be the bridge between the people in north korea and the outside world , because many of us still remain in touch with the brain , and we send them information and money that helps north korea from the inside .
i had such a fortune to get so much help and inspiration in my life that i want to help to success with international assistance .
i 'm sure you 're going to see a lot more successful north the world , including at the stage of ted .
thank you .
i have just one request .
please don 't tell me that i 'm normal .
so i want to introduce you to my brothers .
one hundred is 22 , big , big .
he can 't speak , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers can 't .
what 's love is what love is .
he put them up and he put it in the air .
he 's not a chemist . it doesn 't look at skin .
he doesn 't care about religious differences , and imagine , he has never told a lie .
when he sing songs from our childhood , trying to words that i don 't even remember , i remember , remember , one thing we know about the minds and how wonderful the unknown must be .
samuel is 16. . it 's very good .
he has an absolutely autonomous memory .
he also has a dream of a brain .
he can 't remember if he 's stolen my day , but he remembered the cover of every song on my ipod , conversations that we had when he was four , during the first episode of the eye , and lady 's birthday .
don 't listen to it .
but a lot of people agree .
and in fact , because their minds don 't mean the social version of normal , they 're often understood and wrong .
but what my heart was made and has helped my soul was that although this was the case , although they were not considered a common , dangerous and extraordinary .
well , for those of you who are not so familiar with the term " autism , " it 's a complex brain of the brain that 's learning social communication , learning and sometimes physical skill .
it 's freely different in each individual , so it 's so different to sam .
and the world is determined every 20 minutes in a new person , and even though there 's one of the fastest-growing economies in the world , there are no known cause or cure .
and i can 't remember the first time i 've been confronted autism , but i can 't remind myself .
i was just three years old when my brother was born , and i was so excited that i had a new creature in my life .
and after a few months , i realized that he was different .
he 's a lot of .
he didn 't want to play how it did the other babies , and actually , he seemed to be very interested at all .
it lived and he was in his own world with his own rules , with his own rules , and he found joy of the smallest things , like , cars in a row , the washing machine and everything to eat .
and when he became older , he became different , and the differences became more visible .
but behind the back of the dotcom and the contractor , and the never got to see a really unique hyperactivity : a common and innocent nature , a boy that would never have been lied to the world without prejudice , a human being who never had lied .
extraordinary .
well , i can 't deny that there was some pretty challenging moments in my family , moments that i wish they were .
but i 'm going to go back to the things that you taught me about individuality , and about gender , communication and love , and i understand that these are things that i would not want to trade against the normal .
normality gives the beauty that give us the difference , and the fact that we are different , doesn 't mean that one of us doesn 't mean that one of us is wrong .
it just means that there 's a different kind of right .
and if i could only say one thing about a mile and to sam , and you know , it would be that you don 't have to be normal .
you can be extraordinary .
because , autistic or not , the differences that we have -- we have a gift ! each one of us has a gift in itself , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normal is the ultimate victims of potential .
the opportunity to be on scale , progress and change dies at the moment we 're trying to be different .
please -- don 't tell me i 'm normal .
thank you .
doc 's exposed to us with awe and curiosity , with this photograph on a screen , an apple , and with a million second .
but now , 50 years later , we 're a million times faster , and we don 't see the world with a million or a billion frames per second .
i 'm going to give you a new way of photography , the air interface , a new wave of energy that is so fast that it can make light .
and so we can build cameras that can go away from our body to see corners , or without a x-ray in our body , and really asking what we 're with .
now , if i take a log and i 'm going to put it in a second -- these are multiple -- i 'm creating a package of photons that 's not a millimeter wide and that this carbon 't be a millimeter , that this area is going to be moving at the speed of
so if you take this dough , this pack park and shoot it into this bottle , how are these photons going on in the bottle ?
what 's light in slow motion ?
so , this whole event .
so , think of the whole event actually takes less than a billionth of a time -- as long as the light goes to the air , but i 'm going to take this video to the factor of 10 billion , so you can see the light in motion .
no , coca-cola hasn 't funded this research .
so , in this movie , a lot of things happens , so let me analyze that , and show you what happens .
the pulse , our main space , comes into the bottle with a laser , and that starts to move through and down that end .
part of the light comes out of the table , and you see these spread of waves .
many of the photons are finally reaching the flow of the bottle and explode in different directions .
as you can see , there 's a solar tree that 's in the bottle .
meanwhile , the waves spread out on the table , and because of the bottom line of the top , you see that the panels are concentrated by some images .
now , if you take a frozen and take it to the same run and let it go and let the video go over the factor of 10 billion , you know how long you have to sit here to see the film ?
day a day ? no , a week .
that would be a very boring movie -- from a slow , normal web .
and what about something wrong .
you can see again , like these waves , the wall of the table , the wall of the back .
it 's like when you put a stone into a pond .
i showed it as if nature paint like this , a film of a film , but of course our eye looks like a functional ball .
but if you look at these slides again , you 'll see that when the light goes down the extra warming , it 's going to keep the dark .
why is that ? because the ant 's gone is coming and the light in her turn to it and it comes out after some <NUM> seconds .
so in the future , if this is built in your brain , it could be possible that you could go into a supermarket and find if there 's a cell to do without touching it .
so how did my team built on this camera ?
so , as a photographer , you know , if you make a photo with a brief amount of time , they have very little light , but we 're going to do a billion times faster than your shortest counterparts , so they don 't get light .
so we 're doing this : we send this data , this three-dimensional , the vessel , the weather process , and then we draw that again and again with very clever synchronize , and we combine this data to create these kinds of things that i showed you .
and we can take all these raw things .
so , superman can fly .
other heroes can make invisible , but what about a new wave for a future of future for a future ?
the idea is that we 're going to orbit some light on the door .
it 's going to be going to be going to go into the room , some part of it will bounce back on the door and eventually go back to the camera and we could use this kind of exquisite air of light .
and this is not fiction . we 've even built it .
on the left , you see our surrogate .
behind the wall , a puppet is hidden , and we 're going to put the light on the door .
after our paper was published in nature , it was in the middle of the day , and they created this animation .
and because we have a camera that is so fast -- our learning has some unique capabilities .
it 's got a very good fluid , and it can look at the world at the light .
and of course , we know the distance to the door , but also the hidden objects , but we don 't know what the point is .
by taking a laser up , we can take a laser scan that -- as you see on the screen -- doesn 't really make sense , but then when we take a lot of these images , dozens of these images , and they 're trying to figure out the hidden object , and they 're trying to analyze
can we see it in 3d ?
so this is our reconstruction .
we have a lot to do before we can do that from the lab into practice , we could build cars that avoid the collisions , we could make cars that avoid the curve , or we can search in dangerous for survivors , by looking at light , or we can build the air that 's going deep
but because of the background and fabric , this is a very challenging thing , which is really a call for scientists to think about thinking about thinking about thinking , because a new advance process can actually solve the next generation of medicine .
but it 's also happening .
if you look at these waves under the bottom of the ocean , you see that the waves of us moving away .
the waves should move to us .
what 's going on .
it turned out that we , because we almost have to be able to see , and we almost have strange effects and einstein would have seen this image .
the order of events in the world is going to appear in the world in the opposite order , so by using the same relationship of space and time , we can correct that distortion .
it 's about time . thank you .
there are many ways of how our people can improve our lives .
we don 't meet every neighbors on the street , so many of the problems are not passed down , but we use the same public spaces .
in the last few years , i 've tried to share with my neighbors and things like stickers , and things like the kinds of stickers ,
the projects came out of my questions , how much rent pay my neighbors ?
how can we borrow more things without us ?
how can we share our memories to the national buildings and better to understand the landscape ?
and how can we share our hopes for our own homes , so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams ?
i live in new orleans , and i love new orleans .
my soul is going to be trapped by the giant of the huge mine that has been previously available for hundreds of years , and i 'm a city of the city where there 's always music .
i think every time you get a lot of time , there 's a $ <NUM> set of new orleans .
in this city , some of the most beautiful buildings in the world , but it 's also the city with most national cities in america .
i live near this house and i 've been thinking about how i can do it , and i thought , i also thought about something that changed my life forever .
in 2009 , i lost someone who i loved .
her name was joan , and she was like a mother for me . her death came out and unexpected .
i 've been thinking about death , and i felt a great gratitude for my life , and it taught me clarity about the things that are now important to me now .
but it 's hard to get me to keep this perspective every day .
it 's easy to lose in the day and forgetting that 's really important .
with the help of old and new friends , i turned a side of the mall house into a giant board , and i wrote a saying to the saying , " everybody , the path , can take a piece of chalk , and share his hopes in this public space .
i wasn 't sure what i could expect in the experiment , but the next day , the wall was completely filled , and she grew up .
i want to share some sentences with you that were written by people .
" before i die , i want to be accused of piracy .
" before i die , i want to stand up with the international security club . "
" before i die , i want to sing for millions of people . "
" before i die , i want to plant a tree . "
" before i die , i want to live .
" before i die , i 'd like to hold you back in my arms . "
" before i die , i want to be somebody 's personal . "
" before i die , i 'm going to be a very myself . "
this was a place that was a meaningful place , and the aspiration and the dreams of people made me laugh , and i was crying , and i sat at the hard times .
it 's about knowledge .
it 's about understanding our neighbors and in a new way .
it 's about making space for thinking and to think about what 's most important as we grow and change ourselves .
i made this last year , and i 've got hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall , so my colleagues and i created a steel plan and now they 've created a research plan and now they 've been building the world like kazakhstan , south africa .
we 've shown how much power have our public spaces , if we have the opportunity to move our voices and share more with others .
two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships .
in a world with increasing distractions , it 's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and to think that life is short and delicate .
we 're often stopped talking about death or even thinking about it , but i realized that the preparation is one of the things that we do most of us .
the idea of death is what we 're telling us .
our common places are best about what we 're individuals as individuals and as a community , and with more opportunities , our hopes , to share our hopes , to share our stories , to make us better places .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm talking about math mathematics . a special problem for anyone who 's concerned with this very sophisticated math is that we 're like a lot of the time .
nobody knows what we 're doing .
so i 'm going to try to try to tell you what i do .
dance is one of the most effective activities .
we 're thrilled by the sight of the brain and the color of the way you 're going to see .
for the ballet part , an extraordinarily large amount of brain and abilities , and possibly a basic amount of brain can have a genetic component .
sadly , neurological disorders like parkinson 's slowly is beginning to see this extraordinary ability , which is also a time of my known , which was a nazi .
over the years , you 've done a lot of progress in treatment .
yet there are 6,3 million people in the world who suffer from this disease , and they have to show with the corresponding symptoms like weakness , the brain , and others , and others , and other lives that causes this disease , and therefore we need objective means to discover the disease ,
we need to measure the progress objective , and ultimately the only way to really know whether there is authority , if we have a fixed framework that can answer that question .
now , angry is that there are parkinson 's disease and other people 's brain , so you can 't do a simple solution , so you can 't do a simple type of thing .
you have to do it in the clinic . it 's very expensive , and that means that outside clinical trials will never do that .
but what if patients could make this test home ?
that would be a way to put a tour into the hospital . what if patients could make this test themselves ?
it wouldn 't be expensive .
it costs 300 dollars to be able to look at the recovery .
so i want to suggest a unconventional method that we 're trying to do that , because we 're all , in a certain sense , my well-known , as my well-known , as my well-known ,
so here you see a video of the original picture .
this happens in a healthy condition when someone is creating a lot of money , we can look at ourselves as a desirable problem because we need to coordinate all these kinds of challenges when we make sound , and we all have the genes for it .
and as it requires , it requires a lot of practice .
think about how long a child needs to talk to you .
and by the loud , we can determine the position of the brain , and the way the limbs are also affected by parkinson 's disease .
on the lower record , you can see an example of irregular blood vessels .
we see the same symptoms .
yeah , weakness , weakness ,
the language is even getting stuck in time , and it 's a kind of a big thing for it .
and this impacts on the voice can be minimal , sometimes , but with digital data and technology , combined with a computer machine , learning with a computer machine that 's now very advanced , we can now find where someone is , in a powerful scale between disease and health , just because of the
how can these tests do this testing with some clinical ? well , they 're both the test .
similarly , the infrastructure is already there .
you don 't have to build new clinics for it .
and both are exactly the same . that 's not what the drug companies are doing .
so you can get the core .
they 're very fast , take 30 seconds .
they 're very cheap , and we know what that means .
if something is extremely cheap , you can also use it in a massive scale .
so this amazing goals we can do with this .
we can reduce more sophisticated difficulties .
patients don 't have to do any women 's health workers .
we can get objective data through the brain .
we can do rational education for clinical trials , and we 're going to first get to a study of the whole population .
we have the opportunity to look for first for the disease first before it 's too late .
today , we 're going to do the first step in this direction , and we start the parkinson 's disease .
with the u.k. and the oil companies , we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough levels of water , for which to achieve the goals .
we have estimated that we have a billion people on this planet .
everybody , with no parkinson , can call cheap calls to leave images for a few cents , and i 'll say to joy that we already have six percent of our traffic marrow in just eight hours .
thank you .
if you take samples from , say , let 's take 10.000 people , can you say who 's healthy and who don 't ?
what are you going to do with all these samples ?
what happens is that the patient has to tell during the patient 's disease , whether this person 's disease is suffering .
some people might not be able to finish .
but we collect a huge database , under different circumstances , which is interesting , and these conditions are important because we are , these are the ways that the actual markers of parkinson are .
now , at the moment , you know , 86 percent accuracy ?
it 's much better .
my student -- i have to keep it because he 's done such a fantastic work -- has shown it now that it 's also working on the process of doing what this project allows , and we 're at 99 percent accuracy .
that 's what i call a improvement .
that means people can -- people can call the phone and make the test , and make the test , people with parkinson 's disease , so let 's take your voice to the progress that your doctor can see .
exactly .
thank you very much . max little , ladies and gentlemen .
thank you , tom .
here i live . i live in kenya at the southern edge of the earth .
in the background , you see the cows of my father and that 's the colony .
the tar sands is just a bioluminescent line in south america , which means that wild whales can leave the park at any time .
the predators , the lions , follow them .
they kill our livestock .
this is one of our cows that killed at night , and i woke up in the morning , and i found it dead . it was a terrible competition .
my tribe , the tribe of the masai , believe that we have to deal with our animals and the back of the sky , and that 's why our animals are so much .
i was a kid , i learned to hate lions .
our warriors called our own tribe , and they protect our tribe and our herds .
and killing the lions .
here 's one of six lions that were killed in nairobi .
and i think there 's only so few lions in the national park .
in my tribe , a boy between six and nine years of the cows of his father .
i had to find a solution .
my first idea was fire . lions fear .
but then i realized that this would not really help us , but to help the lions to see the cows better .
but i didn 't give up . i went on .
i had a second idea . i tried to do it .
i wanted the lions to think , i was going to be next to the day .
but lions are very smart animals .
they come , you see the foragers and go back , next time , but you get it and say , this thing 's not moving , that 's still here .
and they 're going to reach our livestock .
one night i was left with the seat . i walked with a bicycle card in the hand around him , and this time the lions wouldn 't attack .
lions fear light .
i had an idea .
i was a little boy , i was working on my room all day , and i even took the new radio of my mom apart , and that day she was going to get me through electronics .
i took an old bicycle tube and a laser scan from a motorcycle , and it shows if you want to turn on the right or left .
and i got a switch to the lights .
this is a little bit of a hamburger from a broken flashlight .
and then i built everything .
the motor is flying the battery , the battery gets power to the gas . i call it a laser .
and the one that 's flashing .
you can see the outside line of the outside , because there 's lions coming from there .
and this is what happens for the lions .
the lights are flashing and the lions believe that i go around the barn .
thank you .
i installed this in our homes , and we had no problems in the problems .
and then we heard our neighbors .
one of them was that .
she had lost many of their animals to lions , and she asked me if i could install her the lights .
and i said , " yeah .
i installed the lights . you can see the patterns in the background .
since then , i 've got seven homes in the neighborhood with the lights and really good .
my idea is now using kenya in kenya , including the number of predators , or leopard , and the lights are also used to keep elephants from remote .
my invention , i was a scholarship at one of the best schools in kenya , south african school , and i 'm really excited .
my new school is dedicated to me , and helps me .
i even brought my friends home , and we put the lights there , where there 's no one , and i 'll show people how to use them .
a year ago , i just had a boy from the savanna who was going to raise cows , and i saw airplanes over me and i said , " one day i 'll sit in one . "
and here i am .
i was allowed to give you a plane for my first tedtalk .
if i 'm big , i want to be a car and i 'll be pilot . that 's my big dream .
i used to hated lions , but through my invention , i can save my father 's cows and the lions that we can , side to side , with the lions , without compromise .
my language is very much like this . thank you very much .
you know , you don 't know how exciting it is to hear a story like your listening .
so you have this scholarship . yeah .
you work on other electrical inventions .
what 's next on the list ?
my next invention , well , i work on an electric fence .
yeah , i know electric fences are invented long , but i want to have my own .
you 've tried it once , not true -- yeah , i tried it , but i 've tried to get a ride back , because i ...
all the beginning is hard . richard ledgett , you 're a little bit special .
we 're going to be crushed by every step of your path , my friend .
thank you very much .
since i was old enough to hold a camera in my hand , photography is my passion , but today i want to share with you 15 of my favorite share of my favorite day .
there was no way of a brain , no sign , no chance of shooting a picture . it wasn 't even the lighting .
and to be honest , most of them were shot by randomly .
my story starts when i was a talk in new york , and my wife was doing this image on her first birthday on my arm , and we were on the corner of the street and the street of the street .
and exactly a year later , we were back in new york , and so we decided to shoot the same picture .
well , you can see what 's going on .
when the third birthday of my daughter said , " hey , why don 't you get the school of new york and make it a job to lead the ritual ? "
so at the time , we started asking the street to make a picture of us .
you know , it 's remarkable , how universal the gesture is when you 're going to get your camera .
no one ever said no , and fortunately , we 've never been able to take our camera .
we didn 't know at the time we didn 't know how much these travel .
this journey has become very sacred .
this one was taken only weeks after september 11. , and i had to explain what happened that day , so that a five-year-old can understand it .
these pictures are much more than just a moment , or a particular journey .
they 're also a possibility for us to stop in october , time , and over our time , and how we change ourselves from year to year not only physically but in everything .
because although we always make the same picture , our perspective of time is going to change , while you get to new milestones , i can see life with your eyes and how it 's going to be .
this very intense time we spend each other 's thing , which we value and expect every year .
so , the day , during our travels , we went through a walk , and suddenly it remained like the blue , and it shows a red residential ring on a pile of a home that you learned as a young child , in the former journeys .
and she told me about her feelings that she felt as an five-year-old at that point .
she said she remembered her heart from her chest , when she saw the store for the first time .
and now she looks at the new york city , because she 's going to go to the new york study .
and i realized , i think the most important thing we all create are memories .
and so i want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious mind .
i don 't know what it looks like , but apart from these 15 pictures , i 'm not a little bit of a traffic .
i 'm always the one who makes the picture .
i want to urge each of you today to come in with the image and don 't pay them to ask someone , " would you like to do a picture of us ? "
thank you .
