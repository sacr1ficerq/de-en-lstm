now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what 's around the bend , or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build <UNK> that can see deep inside the body around <UNK> ,
so when i was writing this talk , i found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , i felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say , " look i 've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , " and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with , " and it doesn 't
i want to look into corruption in afghanistan through a work called " payback " and <UNK> a police officer , set up a fake <UNK> on the street of kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologizing on behalf of the kabul police department -- and hoping that they 'll accept this 100 <UNK> on our behalf .
now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in afghanistan , but personally i don 't want to paint rainbows ; i want to make art that <UNK> identity and challenges authority and <UNK> hypocrisy and <UNK> reality and even uses kind of an imaginative <UNK> to try and understand the world that we live in .
and i 'd like to look at how taking a simple kabul <UNK> and putting it on the wall amidst kipling 's call of <UNK> to generate dialogue about how i see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday 's colonial rhetoric about a " white man 's burden " to save the brown man from himself and maybe even <UNK> him a bit .
i led an initiative by the libyan women 's platform for peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law , a law that would give every citizen , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to <UNK> on political parties the <UNK> of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists , creating the <UNK> list .
now we teach entrepreneurship to <UNK> in <UNK> , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of richard branson 's autobiography , and the task of the <UNK> is to <UNK> , in the first two pages of richard branson 's autobiography how many times richard uses the word " i " and how many times he uses the word " we . "
now if i take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one <UNK> of a second -- which is several <UNK> -- i 'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that packet of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
i decided when i was 27 years old to only respond to people , and i invented a system called enterprise <UNK> , where you never initiate anything , you never motivate anybody , but you become a servant of the local passion , the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
and i helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the <UNK> in <UNK> for 60 cents a kilo , but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to japan for 15 dollars a kilo , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , " hey , you helped them . can you help us ? "
we have groups of volunteers supporting the enterprise facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
the war and the <UNK> life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where i take local afghan fox fur and add it to a <UNK> jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashionable <UNK> <UNK> .
by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn 't really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
so with help from old and new friends , i turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant <UNK> and <UNK> it with a <UNK> sentence : " before i die , i want to ... " so anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
so we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated buddies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic , somebody who will say to you , " what do you need ?
in turn , the word " <UNK> , " which is known in all <UNK> traditions , has the same root in arabic as the word " <UNK> " -- womb -- <UNK> the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tribes , all peoples , have <UNK> from .
our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don 't know about it and understand it , then the work isn 't done , and i believe it 's our responsibility as <UNK> to have these interactions .
take your science , <UNK> your bullet points and your jargon , divide by relevance , meaning share what 's relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you 're doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding .
he doesn 't remember if he stole my chocolate bar , but he remembers the year of release for every song on my ipod , conversations we had when he was four , <UNK> on my arm on the first ever episode of <UNK> , and lady gaga 's birthday .
our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
however , there are <UNK> million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with incurable weakness , tremor , <UNK> and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it 's too late .
and the trick here is to use a single , <UNK> sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what 's being described .
long before that i had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend <UNK> and saturday soccer games and <UNK> with racist children of the <UNK> and <UNK> demonstrations chanting , " down with communism and long live afghanistan , " and burning <UNK> of <UNK> before i even knew what it meant .
unfortunately after you 've gone to school , and you have a résumé and you 've done a few jobs , you can 't say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the president of the united states , but your résumé reads , " underwear model : 10 years , " people give you a funny look .
so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
i made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and i made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including kazakhstan , south africa , australia , argentina and beyond .
it made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry , and this only reinforced why i do this , and people asked me , " fin , aren 't you afraid people are going to steal your food ? "
what i 've come to realize about afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the west , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
i thought it was only us italians <UNK> around africa , but then i saw what the americans were doing , what the english were doing , what the french were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , i became quite proud of our project in zambia .

but unfortunately i have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired nyu ph.d. student counted all the models on the runway , every single one that was hired , and of the <UNK> models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were <UNK> .
with an amazing group of women , i <UNK> the libyan women 's platform for peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the <UNK> empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
why ? because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of new york around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .
it was cool , and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother , and it was just cool to see how this changed them , if it was only for that one moment .
now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a <UNK> — that 's how much time it takes for light to travel — but i 'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .

so , what we do is we send that bullet , those packet of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever <UNK> , and from the gigabytes of data , we <UNK> weave together to create those <UNK> i showed you .
because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new milestones , and i get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
so the city planners , they get together and they figure they 're going to change the name south central to make it represent something else , so they change it to south los angeles , like this is going to fix what 's really going wrong in the city .
what i 'm talking about is putting people to work , and getting kids off the street , and letting them know the joy , the pride and the honor in growing your own food , opening farmer 's markets .
although there was a <UNK> newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said , " a <UNK> is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party , platform or principle , and who , when he wins , gets there by the sheer force of monumental <UNK> <UNK> . "
i had no idea what life was going to be like as a north korean refugee , but i soon learned it 's not only extremely difficult , it 's also very dangerous , since north korean refugees are considered in china as illegal migrants .

but what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary .
now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we 're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you 're going to get hardly any light .
now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . foxp2 , for example .
when i was a teenager , i was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a " sorry , officer , " and we were on our way .
because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- we 've got a gift ! everyone 's got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
my story begins when i was in new york city for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . we 're on the corner of <UNK> and 5th .
i do have too many <UNK> heels which i never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that i get is the free stuff that i get in real life , and that 's what we don 't like to talk about .
and those things are true , but they 're only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that i have never said on camera , is , " i am insecure . "
but i cast my mind back to the things that they 've taught me about individuality and communication and love , and i realize that these are things that i wouldn 't want to change with normality .

now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you 'll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
so , in the future , when this <UNK> is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it .
but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about <UNK> as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
when i returned to afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
so l.a. times got <UNK> of it . steve lopez did a story on it and talked to the <UNK> , and one of the green grounds members , they put up a petition on <UNK> , and with 900 signatures , we were a success .

anyone healthy or with parkinson 's can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and i 'm really happy to announce that we 've already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
but we 'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it 's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the <UNK> factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
so what that means is that people will be able to — people will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with parkinson 's could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they 're doing in this course of the disease .
since i was a small boy , i used to work in my room for the whole day , and i even took apart my mom 's new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but i learned a lot about electronics .
they 're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in october and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .

well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we 're biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , slender figures , and <UNK> and white skin .
they are constructions , and they are constructions by a group of professionals , by <UNK> and makeup artists and photographers and <UNK> and all of their assistants and <UNK> and <UNK> , and they build this . that 's not me .
i was given a slap in the face reading a book , " small is beautiful , " written by <UNK> , who said , above all in economic development , if people do not wish to be helped , leave them alone .
so years and years ago , i had this idea : why don 't we , for once , instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do , why don 't , for once , listen to them ? but not in community meetings .
the smallest company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beautifully : the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
so i asked my phone company , <UNK> <UNK> , which was at that time the largest phone company in germany , and i asked them , please , send me all the information you have stored about me .
and i know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some <UNK> who are , like , " wait . naomi . <UNK> . joan <UNK> . <UNK> <UNK> . "

i want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
and so i stand here today , afghan by blood , <UNK> by the grace of god , an atheist and a radically <UNK> artist who 's been living , working and creating in afghanistan for the last nine years .
and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an x-ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
we need to be able to measure progression objectively , and ultimately , the only way we 're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
approaching my daughter 's third birthday , my wife said , " hey , why don 't you take <UNK> back to new york and make it a <UNK> trip , and continue the ritual ? "

but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point i want to leave you on , is that the title , president of the united states of america , doesn 't sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
i want to spend a day in the life of a <UNK> <UNK> who wears his jihad against the <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> and uses armed religious <UNK> and political corruption to make himself rich .

so what i want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all <UNK> like my friend <UNK> <UNK> .
they will come the first day and they see the <UNK> , and they go back , but the second day , they 'll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it 's always here .

when you go home , tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information , they don 't have to do it .

but to really show you how words and politics interact , i want to take you back to the united states of america , just after they 'd achieved independence .
i mean , some people wanted him to be called chief <UNK> washington , and other people , his <UNK> george washington , and other people , protector of the liberties of the people of the united states of america washington .
and so , in the end , the senate won and the house of representatives lost , because nobody 's going to feel that humble when they 're told that they are now the president of the united states of america .

but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light washes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn 't become dark .
it 's going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light .
in our age of increasing distractions , it 's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
i even took my friends back to my community , and we 're installing the lights to the homes which don 't have [ any ] , and i 'm teaching them how to put them .
but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from <UNK> to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
this morning , the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , " can we -- can you imagine a city that is not <UNK> ? "

what we do , we 're a <UNK> kind of group , where it 's composed of gardeners from all walks of life , from all over the city , and it 's completely volunteer , and everything we do is free .

and i got these free things because of how i look , not who i am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
our society , shaped by a revolutionary mindset , became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles -- freedom , dignity , social justice -- that we first held .

you already tried it once , right , and you -- i tried it before , but i stopped because it gave me a shock .

" kill me now , if you wish , " he said , " but i will not ruin my daughter 's future because of your old and backward ideas . "

i joined forces with many other <UNK> inside and outside libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the <UNK> regime of gaddafi .

who calls whom ? who sends whom an email ?
and if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
and i also ask myself , does it really work ?
so i got this ugly brown envelope with a <UNK> inside .

this is six months of my life , into this file .
this is a visualization of six months of my life .
the fall of the berlin wall would maybe not [ have been ] there .
and in the aftermath , also not the fall of the iron curtain .
and i figured , this has to stop .
so i figured that the problem is the solution .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
thing is , it 's owned by the city .
and i 'm like , " come on , really ?
i mean , come on , why wouldn 't they ?
why in the hell would they not okay this ?

they 're high-speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
no need to go to the clinic for a routine <UNK> .
you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
so i didn 't give up . i continued .
and i discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
i 'm always the one taking the picture .
it was the only way we both could be educated .
so do you still not want to continue ? "
instead , everything we touched we killed .

jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
i 'm a child of 1984 , and i live in the city of berlin .
they said , we don 't want this data retention .
but you have to fight for your self-determination today .
so what i did , i planted a food forest in front of my house .
if kids grow <UNK> , kids eat <UNK> .
if they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes .
and when we do this , who knows ?
we might produce the next george washington <UNK> .
and let that be your weapon of choice .
what do you call the leader of a republican country ?
and there were all sorts of suggestions on the table , which might have made it .
reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur .
and so the senate won in the end .
that is my burden . what 's yours ?
so luckily i brought an outfit change .
you know ? you can be anything .
hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
and there it was , a great revolution .
eventually , our initiative was adopted and successful .
this was one of the lowest points in my life .
<UNK> is 22 , tall and very handsome .
but , coca-cola did not sponsor this research .

it 's about time . thank you .
so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
the neurologist 's test is non-invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
so here are some amazing goals that i think we can deal with now .
we can do <UNK> monitoring to get objective data .
what are you going to get out of those samples ?
so i grew up hating lions so much .
so he jumps in and kills the animals .
so you got this scholarship . yep .
my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
like me , they are dreaming big .
the first principle of aid is respect .
let me tell you a secret .
<UNK> way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
government ? forget about it !
they were already drowning in manure .
first , you have to offer them <UNK> .
nobody started a company alone . no one .
all this is possible with your mobile phone .
who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
<UNK> was the secret police in east germany .
every time i use my mobile phone ?
all this is possible with this information .
but it is not only about me .
because this time it wasn 't coming up .
we had a victory on our hands .
see , i 'm an artist .
that 's why it 's on the street .
now don 't get me wrong .
we gotta flip the script on what a <UNK> is .
and this was debated in congress for ages and ages .
some people just wanted to call him king .
it was like the foreman of the jury .
now you can learn three interesting things from this .
but this is the geography of self .
here 's me on the same day as this shoot .
sometimes , i saw dead bodies floating down the river .
these north koreans were not so lucky .
where am i from ? who am i ?
" i 'm helping the north korean people . "
now i 'd like to introduce you to my brothers .
but there 's also something funny going on here .
no one knows what the hell we do .
you don 't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
we can reduce logistical difficulties with patients .
and i said , " yes . "
what 's the next one on your list ?
it 's really become sacred to us .
a morning that i will never forget .
do they know where we live ?
but my educated mother became a teacher .
today i am 22 .
and of course , everything in africa grew beautifully .
but they mean two different things .
we don 't work from offices .
you can give somebody an idea .
there is a problem with community meetings .
you have to create a new profession .
planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .
<UNK> , michigan . henry ford .
hi . this is my mobile phone .
and i will talk about this .
these are <UNK> lines of information .
and why are these <UNK> there ?
this directive [ is ] called data retention directive .
and on the <UNK> , this was on .
you have to fight for it every day .
i got tired of seeing this happening .
i see dialysis centers popping up like starbucks .
it 's 150 feet by 10 feet .
they own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
something to do with words , i assume .
they thought it was tried and tested .
and that title was " president . "
and that 's why the senate objected to it .
they got their title of <UNK> .
actually , for 10 years .
not everybody gets to do that .
so why did i do that ?
it will look something like this .
we did not prioritize right .
no , it didn 't .
today i have just one request .
<UNK> knows what love is .
he has the most <UNK> memory .
he has a selective one , though .
don 't they sound incredible ?
but most people don 't agree .
how does light look in slow motion ?
can we see it in full 3d ?
so this is our reconstruction .
so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
no expensive staff time required .
that means they can be <UNK> .
so you 're 86 percent accurate right now ?
but lions are very clever .
so i set up everything .
and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
one of them was this grandmother .
you 're working on other electrical inventions .
my family believes in me .
because , you see , at least we fed the <UNK> .
the book was published in 2009 .
just go and read her book .
the most important thing is passion .
so planning has this blind spot .
the internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
the technologies do not exist to do that .
this person has never been born .
who sends whom a text message ?
i want to make them public .
that 's a little bit scary .
it 's about all of us .
you can see all of this .
i live in south central .
this is south los angeles .
<UNK> stores , fast food , vacant lots .
but you have to maintain it .
and the garden , it was beautiful .
and then somebody complained .
that 's 20 central parks .
that 's the whole idea .
just because it sounds so good .
my friend got to come with me .
and here 's me today .
that 's the real <UNK> .
and i was very proud .
she 's not north korean . "
these girls were so lucky .
am i south korean or north korean ?
i lost all hope .
now , the whole event
so , superman can fly .
on the left , you see our <UNK> .
we see all the same symptoms .
we see vocal tremor , weakness and <UNK> .
ninety-nine . well , that 's an improvement .
so i had to find a way of solving this problem .
and here i am today .
thank you so much . thank you .
we have zero infrastructure .
it doesn 't exist .
hold it up .
<UNK> thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information .
we are the soil .
plus you get strawberries .
they didn 't know .
and , you know , it could have worked .
what is it , then ?
i was so shocked .
i even went through an identity crisis .
he screamed a lot .
you can be extraordinary .
it 's much better than that .
they kill our livestock .
so they kill the lions .
so i had an idea .
and the indicator box makes the lights flash .
a real school .
were we being followed ?
there she is .
and i was <UNK> .
guess what ?
we activate communities .
and i was scared .
so what happened ?
peace . thank you .
not that <UNK> .
that was awkward .
but many die .
what 's going on here ?
thanks , tom .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you very much .
all right .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
raw data .
thank you .
a hundred and <UNK> .
thank you .
thank you .
